# rock-paper-scissors
This project focuses on applying the basic JavaScript concepts I've learned. Inspired by pokemon battle sequences, I combined them with rock paper scissors to form a turn-based rock paper scissors battle.

Concepts I practiced in this project:
- JS basics
- CSS basics
- CSS keyframes
- DOM Manipulation with JS
- proper comment conventions
- debugging JS using devtools, breakpoints, watching variables
- git commit message conventions
